Moodle Development Kit
======================

A collection of tools meant to make developers' lives easier.

Requirements
============

- Linux or Mac OS
- Python 2.7
- MySQL, MariaDB or PostgreSQL
- Git v1.7.7 or greater

Most of the tools work on Moodle 1.9 onwards, but some CLI scripts required by MDK might not be available in all versions.

Usage
=====

The commands are called using that form::

    mdk <command> <arguments>

Get some help on a command using::

    mdk <command> --help

Also check the `wiki <https://github.com/FMCorz/mdk/wiki>`_.

Installation
============

Python package
--------------

On Debian-based systems, install the following packages::

    sudo apt-get install python-pip libmysqlclient-dev libpq-dev python-dev unixodbc-dev

Use `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html>`_::

    sudo pip install moodle-sdk
    mdk init

That's it!


Homebrew
--------

Using `Homebrew <http://brew.sh/>`_, please refer to this `formula <https://github.com/danpoltawski/homebrew-mdk>`_.


For development
---------------

Clone the repository::

    git clone git://github.com/FMCorz/mdk.git moodle-sdk

On Debian-based systems, you will need to install the following packages::

    sudo apt-get install python-pip libmysqlclient-dev libpq-dev python-dev unixodbc-dev

Then from the directory where you cloned the repository::

    sudo python setup.py develop
    mdk init


Bash completion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To activate bash completion::

    sudo ln -s /path/to/moodle-sdk/extra/bash_completion /etc/bash_completion.d/moodle-sdk

To activate goto commands (``gt`` and ``gtd``), add the following to ~/.bashrc::

    if [ -f /path/to/moodle-sdk/extra/goto_instance ]; then
        . /path/to/moodle-sdk/extra/goto_instance
        . /path/to/moodle-sdk/extra/goto_instance.bash_completion
    fi


Upgrading
=========

If you installed MDK using PIP, run the following command::

    sudo pip install --upgrade moodle-sdk

It is possible that a new version of MDK requires new files, directories, etc... and while we try to make it easy to upgrade, it can happen that some features get broken in your environment. So after each upgrade, consider running the following to get more information::

    mdk doctor --all


Command list
============

alias
-----

Set up aliases of your Moodle commands.

**Example**

This line defines the alias 'upall', for 'moodle update --all'

Backports the branch MDL-12345-23 from the instance stable_23 to the instance stable_22, and pushes the new branch to your remote

uninstall
---------

Uninstall an instance: removes config file, drops the database, deletes dataroot content, ...


update
------

Fetch the latest stables branches from the upstream remote and pull the changes into the local stable branch.

**Examples**

This updates the instances stable_22 and stable_23

::

    mdk update stable_22 stable_23

This updates all your integration instances and runs the upgrade script of Moodle.

::

    mdk update --integration --upgrade


upgrade
-------

Run the upgrade script of your instance.

**Examples**

The following runs an upgrade on your stable branches

::

    mdk upgrade --stable

This will run an update an each instance before performing the upgrade process

::

    mdk upgrade --all --update

Scripts
=======

You can write custom scripts and execute them on your instances using the command ``mdk run``. MDK looks for the scripts in the *scripts* directories and identifies their type by reading their extension. For example, a script called 'helloworld.php' will be executed as a command line script from the root of an installation.

::

    # From anywhere on the system
    $ mdk run helloworld stable_master

    # Is similar to typing the following command
    $ cp /path/to/script/helloworld.php /path/to/moodle/instances/stable_master
    $ cd /path/to/moodle/instances/stable_master
    $ php helloworld.php

Scripts are very handy when it comes to performing more complexed tasks.

Shipped scripts
---------------

The following scripts are available with MDK:

* ``dev``: Changes a portion of Moodle settings to enable development mode
* ``enrol``: Enrols users in any existing course
* ``external_functions``: Refreshes the definitions of services and external functions
* ``makecourse``: Creates a test course
* ``mindev``: Minimalist set of development settings (performance friendly)
* ``setup``: Setup for development by running a succession of other scripts
* ``tokens``: Lists the webservice tokens
* ``undev``: Reverts the changes made by ``dev`` and ``mindev``
* ``users``: Creates a set of users
* ``version``: Fixes downgrade version conflicts
* ``webservices``: Does all the set up of webservices for you
